# Aviation Risk Analysis (1962â€“2022)
This project analyzes over 80,000 aircraft accident and incident records from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Its goal is to help a company entering the aviation industry assess and select low-risk aircraft for commercial and private operations


## Project Goal
Our main goal is to identify aircraft models and engine types that have historically shown the lowest rates of severe damage and fatalities. This information is key for making smart decisions when buying new aircraft and planning flight routes for our company's new aviation business


## Key Project Features

-Data Used: Cleaned and analyzed historical accident data from NTSB (1962â€“2022).

-Risk Metrics: Developed custom indicators like fatality rates, uninjured rates, and incident rates per engine type.

-Interactive Dashboard: A Tableau dashboard is included for exploring the data and insights visually.

-Aircraft Ranking: Aircraft are ranked based on safety, damage levels, weather impact, and engine type.

-Business Recommendations: Practical advice for aircraft procurement, backed by our data analysis.

## Sample Visualizations
Bar chart: Aircraft Frequency and Manufacturing Trends
Aircraft Damage by Engine Type
Top States with Most Aircraft Accidents
Weather Condition and Risk

Other Visuals: The Tableau dashboard also includes charts on fatality rates, Timeline Trend, damage by weather conditions, and aircraft safety scores by make and model

## Business Recommendations

1.Invest in Multi-Engine Turbine Aircraft: Prioritize buying aircraft with two or more Turbofan or Turboprop engines, as they historically show lower rates of severe damage.
2.Choose low-risk aircraft models like the Cessna 150, Piper PA-28, or similar based on the lowest average fatality rate.
3.Set up clear internal processes to record all incident details accurately. This helps us continuously learn and improve safety for our own fleet..
4.Use insights from weather impact and incident data to plan flights safely and develop predictive maintenance programs.

## How to Use
Explore the Analysis: Open project.ipynb to see how the data was cleaned and analyzed step-by-step.
Interact with the Dashboard: Use Tableau Desktop (or Tableau Reader) to open Aircraft Risk Insights (1962â€“2022).twbx for an interactive look at the findings.
Customize: You can adapt the code and dashboard to suit your specific risk calculations or fleet needs.
